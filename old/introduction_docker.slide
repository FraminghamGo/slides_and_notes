* Introduction to Docker

.image https://www.docker.com/sites/default/files/moby.svg

* What Is Docker?

Docker is an open source project that automates the deployment of applications inside software containers.

Got that? o_O

* Let's break this down

Docker is an *open* *source* *project* that automates the deployment of applications inside software containers.

- Docker is an organization, as well as software
- Open Source - http://github.com/docker
- Written in Go
- Works on linux, macos, and windows

* Let's skip ahead

Docker is an open source project that automates the deployment of applications *inside* *software* *containers*.

- According to wikipedia: Docker containers wrap up a piece of software in a complete filesystem that contains everything it needs to run: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries â€“ anything you can install on a server. This guarantees that it will always run the same, regardless of the environment it is running in.

* Let's go back to the middle

Docker is an open source project that automates the *deployment* *of* *applications* inside software containers.

What applications?

- Go App
- Database App?
- Binary App?

* And finally, automate

Docker is an open source project that *automates* the deployment of applications inside software containers.

- Dockerfile
- hub.docker.com (_Pre-existing_ _recipes_)

* How do we get started?

- Download / install a binary from Docker.com
- Once install, macos users will find a whale on their top menu
- Windows users: systray(?)

* A simple example

  docker run ubuntu /bin/echo 'Hello world'

Example dockerfiles

- https://github.com/kstaken/dockerfile-examples
- Apache Example
  docker build -t my-apache2 .
  docker run -itp 80:80 --name my-running-app my-apache2

* Expand your docker world by using `docker-compose`

Docker compose is where the magic is at in my opinion.
